abstract: "
How well do humans know their own motives? As veridical as introspection might seem, many scientists question subjective reports on motives, deeming them biased, inaccurate, and no more revealing than inferences made by outside observers. Such concerns about introspection are often cited, but less often tested. Here we present an approach for modeling introspective accuracy and bias. Across five experiments (N= 2191), we systematically compare people’s subjective reports of how much they want different outcomes to the preferences revealed by their actual choices. To probe biases, we compare a choice domain which typically features self-image concerns (reporting prosocial motivation) with one which does not (reporting nonsocial motives; Experiments 1a & 1b). To test for an insider advantage in introspective accuracy, we examine how accurately paired observers infer deciders’ motives before and after viewing their choices relative to deciders (Experiment 2). Finally, to probe whether subjective reports capture dynamic changes in motives, we examine introspective accuracy before and after experimentally shifting people’s social preferences (Experiments 3a & 3b). Across all studies, we find evidence of robust introspective accuracy. Subjective reports of motives not only exceed chance and inferences made by observers, but also accurately adjust when preferences change. We see such accuracy despite also detecting a bias: individuals whose motives violate their own standards tend to distort their level of prosocial motivation. By developing a method for probing the precision of motive introspection, this work challenges assumptions about its inherent unreliability—highlighting the value of integrating subjective reports into models of human decision-making.
