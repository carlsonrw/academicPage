Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in Social Psychology at Yale University advised by [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/). How do determine who to trust, befriend, and support in social life? I study the mechanisms by which we come to know our own and other people's motives in social situations--including the mechanisms that hone and bias our inferences, as well as how these inferences shape our minds and downstream behavior. To learn more about my work, check out my [publications](carlsonr.com/#featured) below, or my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kDJTGIUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
