I’m a Research Scientist at the [Constructive Dialogue Institute](https://constructivedialogue.org/) (CDI). At CDI, I build AI-powered tools and conduct research to help individuals and institutions communicate across differences and foster cultures of constructive dialogue. My broader research seeks to answer fundamental questions about human motivation and morality through behavioral experiments and computational modelling. Some of this work has been featured in outlets such as [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211122-why-overly-kind-and-moral-people-can-rub-you-up-the-wrong-way), [Time](https://time.com/5859459/in-defense-of-virtue-signaling-2/), and [Discover](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/how-will-we-remember-the-coronavirus-pandemic). 

I received my BA (Hons.) from Simon Fraser University (in Vancouver, Canada), my PhD from Yale University, and my postdoctoral training from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Before graduate school, I worked as a research coordinator for two years at the Stanford Social Neuroscience Laboratory. I am a content expert in social, moral, and motivational psychology, and have a strong metholodoligical background in neuroimaging, computational modelling, and most recently: AI.
