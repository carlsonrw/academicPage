I'm a PhD candidate in Psychology at Yale University. Before my PhD, I completed my BA (Hons.) in Psychology at Simon Fraser University in Canada, and worked as a research assistant for two years in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University.

Why do people sometimes view acts of kindness as driven by altruistic concern for others, and sometimes write-off such acts as self-interested? The difference between these two inferences can have vital implications for who we trust, befriend, and support, as well as how we see ourselves. In my work, I examine how we come to know our own and other people's motives in social life, as well as how these inferences shape our minds and behavior. To address these questions, I use theoretical insights from social psychology and methods from computational cognitive science. My research on these topics has been covered in popular press outlets, including [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211122-why-overly-kind-and-moral-people-can-rub-you-up-the-wrong-way), [Time](https://time.com/5859459/in-defense-of-virtue-signaling-2/), and [Discover](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/how-will-we-remember-the-coronavirus-pandemic). For more details on my research, check out my [publications](#featured) below, or on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kDJTGIUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
