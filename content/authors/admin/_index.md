I'm a PhD candidate in Psychology at Yale University. Before my PhD, I completed my BA (Hons.) in Psychology at Simon Fraser University in Canada, and then worked as a research assistant for two years in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University.

How well do we know our own and other people's motives in social life? How is our knowledge about what motivates us influenced by those around us? Why do we sometimes see other people's actions as motivated by self-interest or hate? Addressing these questions is key to understanding the roots of human trust and human conflict. In my work, I study how people come to know their own and other people's motives in social life, as well as the social consequences of these perceptions. To address these questions, I use theoretical insights from social psychology and methods from cognitive science. My research on these topics has been covered in popular press outlets, including [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211122-why-overly-kind-and-moral-people-can-rub-you-up-the-wrong-way), [Time](https://time.com/5859459/in-defense-of-virtue-signaling-2/), and [Discover](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/how-will-we-remember-the-coronavirus-pandemic). For more details on my research, check out my [publications](#featured) below, or on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kDJTGIUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
