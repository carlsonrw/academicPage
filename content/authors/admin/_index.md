How well do we know our own motives? How is our knowledge about what motivates us influenced by those around us? Why do we sometimes see others, but rarely see ourselves, as motivated by self-interest? In my research, I examine these and other questions at the intersection of motivation, morality, and decision-making. Some of my research on these topics has been covered in popular press outlets, including [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211122-why-overly-kind-and-moral-people-can-rub-you-up-the-wrong-way), [Time](https://time.com/5859459/in-defense-of-virtue-signaling-2/), and [Discover](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/how-will-we-remember-the-coronavirus-pandemic). 

I'm currently a Principal Researcher at Chicago Booth working with [Ayelet Fishbach](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/f/ayelet-fishbach). I received my PhD in Psychology from Yale University (advised by [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/people)) and my BA in Psychology from Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada. Before graduate school, I worked as a full-time research assistant for two years with [Jamil Zaki](https://www.ssnl.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.
