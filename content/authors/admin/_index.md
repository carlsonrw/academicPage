I'm a social psychologist and PhD candidate at Yale University working with [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/). One major focus of my research is how we come to know our own and other people's motives in social situations. In other words: when do we see people's kind or moral acts as motivated by concern for others, and when do we attribute them to self-interest? The difference between these two inferences can have vital social implications for whether we choose to trust, befriend, and support others. My research examines the mechanisms that support (and bias) such inferences, as well as how these inferences shape our minds (for instance, our internal models of what motivates people in social life), as well as our downstream behavior. To learn more about my work, check out my [publications](carlsonr.com/#featured) below, or my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kDJTGIUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
