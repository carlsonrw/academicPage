Iâ€™m a Research Scientist at the Constructive Dialogue Institute, where I build AI tools and conduct research to help individuals and institutions communicate across differences and foster cultures of constructive dialogue. My broader research draws on insights from computational social psychology, behavioral economics, and organizational behavior to study human motives and morality. My research has been featured in outlets such as [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211122-why-overly-kind-and-moral-people-can-rub-you-up-the-wrong-way), [Time](https://time.com/5859459/in-defense-of-virtue-signaling-2/), and [Discover](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/how-will-we-remember-the-coronavirus-pandemic). 

Before CDI, I was a Principal Researcher at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I received my PhD in Psychology from Yale University and my BA in Psychology from Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada. Before graduate school, I worked as a full-time research assistant for two years at Stanford University.
