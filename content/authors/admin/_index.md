How well do we know our own motives in social life? How is our knowledge about what motivates us influenced by those around us? Why do we sometimes see other people's actions as motivated by self-interest? Addressing these questions is key to understanding the roots of human trust and human conflict. In my research, I examine these and other questions at the intersection of motivation, morality, and social cognition. To this end, I use theoretical insights from social psychology and methods from cognitive science. My research on these topics has been covered in popular press outlets, including [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211122-why-overly-kind-and-moral-people-can-rub-you-up-the-wrong-way), [Time](https://time.com/5859459/in-defense-of-virtue-signaling-2/), and [Discover](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/how-will-we-remember-the-coronavirus-pandemic). For more details on my research, check out my [publications](#featured) below, or on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kDJTGIUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

I'm currently a Principal Researcher at Chicago Booth working with [Ayelet Fishbach](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/f/ayelet-fishbach). Before Booth, I received my PhD in Psychology from Yale University, where I was advised by [Molly Crockett](http://www.crockettlab.org/people). Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my BA (Hons.) in Psychology with [Lara Aknin](https://www.sfu.ca/psychology/research/hhl.html) at Simon Fraser University, and worked as a full-time research assistant with [Jamil Zaki](https://www.ssnl.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University.
